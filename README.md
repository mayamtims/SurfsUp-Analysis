# SurfsUp-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to compare June and December temperatures on Oahu, Hawaii to determine if the surf shop will attract customers year-round. Using Python, Pandas and SQLAlchemy, a dataset was retrieved from the hawaii.sqlite database. The temperature data from June and December were then queried and transferred into Pandas Dataframes, and the summary statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile and maximum) of each were obtained. 

## Results
There are three major points we can takeaway from the comparison:
1. The average temperature in June (74.9 degrees) and the average temperature in December (71.0 degrees) differ only by a few degrees. Both months have great temperatures for surfing and ice cream.
2. The minimum temperature in December (56 degrees) is noticeably lower than June's minimum temperature (64 degrees). During the coldest days in December ice cream profits may be less than during June's coldest days.
3. There are 1700 points of data for the month of June and 1517 for the month of December. There is enough
